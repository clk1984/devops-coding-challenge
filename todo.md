This is a list of tasks that I consider would be necessary for this application to be production-ready. Some of them are more important than the ones I have done, but time has caught up with me.


[ ] Dont run docker app as root 
[ ] use git secrets or repo variables to avoid versioning .env
[ ] Https :Generate certificate , configure server
[ ] close ec2 instances to network traffic
[ ] add a step to destroy infra workflow to clean ecr registry 
[ ] run migrations on app launch
[ ] Check parametrization to make it reusable (pipeline is almost usable on stg and dev branch also)
